# Online Multiplayer Monopoly v3.0

This is the third iteration of a web-based Monopoly game originally started as a class group project. Version 3.0 builds on prior forks, reworking the app from the ground up with a focus on applying better development practices. While earlier versions laid the groundwork, this release aims to deliver a more complete, playable experience.
